# [Scratchpad] GoLang Prometheus Metrics

This repo attempts to understand how to add metrics to a golang project.


# How to run it?

The folder `cmd` has the multiple options I was testing. You can do

```bash
go run cmd/without-collector/main.go
```

and in your browser go to `localhost:9090/metrics`.
